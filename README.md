# Kuit
Kuit is a Kotlin base GUI abstraction layer.

Pronouniced like cute.

# Goal

Kuit does not provide GUI implementation like Flutter, Android, iOS, Browser does.
Instead, it provide a GUI abstraction layer so you can write kotlin code to implements GUI,
while still facilitate Kotlin's multi platform ability. To implements we must
implementate the abstraction layer on different platform, like android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, Browser, etc.
